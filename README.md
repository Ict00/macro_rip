# mini-rip — A minimal programming language.
**mini-rip** is a minimal, esoteric, interpreted programming language the official implementation of which is written in Lua. This project takes heavy inspiration from [T^ (TGlyph)](https://github.com/tixonochekAscended/TGlyph) — another programming language I made. To execute code, you as a programmer use special **sigils**, that are basically one-character symbols at the beginning of each line. Afterwards you pass arguments to that sigil to do certain actions. As I've just mentioned, the language is pretty minimal — however you can easily expand on it yourself so that is not a bad thing. If you are curious, in the source code you'll find a lexer, parser and an abstract executor.
